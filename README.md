Calculation tools for sum and difference tones (very primitive computer-assisted composition)

This repo contains some tools I wrote to automate calculations I dealt with while composing a number of pieces that use combination tones as musical material.

Difftones.hs contains a summation of most material, 1127fm.hs contains an extension from single difference tones to the wide-ranging combination tones one gets from frequency modulation (FM) synthesis. I need to clean things up.
